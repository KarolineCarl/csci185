      <h1>Copy Paste Project </h1>
      <p>SUMMARY:</br> Using Google Image search with advanced functions, download high-resolution album covers or movie posters image files of source material that you can remix to create a total of 10 compositions as you explore the remix strategies listed below. 
    <br>P1 COPY/TRANSFORM/COMBINE  10 compositions.
    <br>
    <br>1. Single Source Remix </br>
    <br>
    <br>In this strategy, use one album cover or movie poster for the remix; you reinterpret it using only parts from that same image that you re-arrange and resize. Start with approaching the canvas as a virtual space; size conveys proximity, so smaller elements will seem further away and closer elements will seem larger.</br>
    
    <br>
    <br>2. Mashup=2 or more sources combined</br>
    <br>
    The mashup utilizes parts from 2 separate imagesâ€“both are clearly identifiable so that the viewer can understand the references. When you do this option you also get 2 compositions out of it swapping the parts from both.
    
    <br>When you put two things together, regardless of how unrelated, you create a third thing. </br>
    
    The next level to this is to intentionally choose your two images to combine with some kind of relationship in mind. Sometimes the choice is logic is obvious, sometimes intuitive, and perhaps sometimes an absurd experiment.
    <br>
   <br> 3. Echo (the alt/option shift plus direction arrow technique)</br>
    <br>
    Select a layer and use the option+shift+directional arrow hotkey (any direction) to create a sense of visual rhythm or a flow of movement. As layers accumulate visually, you will start to notice a depth/3D-like quality emerge. You can select this set of layers and group them with the command+g command, which will allow you to move them together as a group and fold the layers to unclutter your layers window. Experiment. 
    <br>
    <br>4. Dirty Remix </br>
    <br>
    How radical/abstract can you get? No constraints, but the concept has to somehow be discernible in the end result, i.e. if doing an album, you can still tell who the artist is. You can start with the content-aware technique (recipe below key command list).</br></p>

                        <p>SUMMARY:<br>

                            Animation is a media production method in which images are manipulated to appear as moving by changing states and positions over time. There are several basic types of animation:
                            <br></br>
                           <br>Traditional 2D Animation. (Frame)</br>
                            
                          <br>  3D Animation. (CGI, Computer Animation)</br>
                            
                           <br> Motion Graphics. (Typography, Animated Logos)</br>
                            
                            <br>Stop Motion. (Claymation, Cut-Outs)</br>
                            
                            
                           <br> The kind of animation we will be practicing for this project is frame animation, which has a contemporary digital form as animated GIFs.</br></p>

                    <p>SUMMARY: <br>

                      <br>  In this exercise we will learn to apply techniques of editing, masking, and blending to accomplish a more sophisticated result. <br>
                        
                       <br> In each composition, you will combine (at least) 2 separate images together in experimental/imaginative ways that combine forms into photorealistic compositions that look  UNCANNY/REAL/COHESIVE in contrast to the cut-out look of P1. For this project, you will create a total of 10 compositions.<br></p>
