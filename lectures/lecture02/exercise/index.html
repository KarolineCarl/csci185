    <p>Cake is necessary,<br>
<br>
      It’s part of growing up! <br>
      <br>
      
      From gooey chocolate fudge to the simple cup. <br>
      <br>
      
      Flour and butter,<br>
      <br>
      
      Eggs and milk.<br>
      <br>
      
      Marzipan toppings as soft as silk.<br>
      <br>
      
      Whenever I’m happy,<br>
      <br>
      
      Whenever I’m sad,<br>
      <br>
      
      When I’ve got cake, I’m ever so glad!<br>
